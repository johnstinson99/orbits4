# orbits4
Orbit calculation program, branched from original work by Jamie Stinson

Run src/__init__
Alter the masses of the bodies and distances between them to see interesting effects, 
e.g. planets spiralling in towards each other and speed increasing, after the distance between the stars becomes uneven.
